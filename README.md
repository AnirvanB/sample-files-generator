# Sample Files Generator
Bash script to create sample files for icon themes preview.
 
Created to help me for the creation of my personal work, [Boston Icons](https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1012402/).


### Notes and how to use

* To give permissions: `chmod +x ./samples.sh`

* Run with: `./samples.sh`

* Double click can run it without command prompt, but this method doesn't show any message.
